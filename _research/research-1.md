    title: "Kinematic and Dynamics of Continetal Rifting"
    excerpt: "Understanding the dynamics of plate motions remains a key challenge in geosciences. It is well established that there are 3 main far-field forces that drive plate motions (1) lithospheric buoyancy forces arising from lateral gradients of gravitational potential energy (GPE) in the lithosphere; (2) mantle tractions or basal drag that arise from viscous coupling between the lithosphere and convective motions within Earth's mantle; and (3)  slab pull forces that arise from the net pull of slabs descending into the mantle. Over the past few decades, geodetic and paleomagnetic observations have been extensively used to infer plate motions (kinematic), while seismic anisotropy (SKS splitting) observations have been used to infer mantle dynamics. However, there is still lack of understanding of force balance driving plate motions, which is partly due to lack of computational modeling capabilities for testing hypotheses."
