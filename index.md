# About Me
**I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Earth and Environnemental Sciences at [New Mexico Tech](https://www.nmt.edu/).** By integrating geodynamic modeling and geodetic data, I seek to improve our understanding of the geodynamics of active tectonics. In particular, I am intersted in studying the long-term evolution of geodynamic processes from lithospheric/crustal scales to the mantle, with applications to plate interior and plate boundary deformation, natural hazards, and subsurface energy resource development. <br><br> My main tools are: 1) 3D thermomechanical modeling with the open-source finite-element code Advanced Solver for Problems in Earthâ€™s ConvecTion ([ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org/)), which I use to calculate surface deformation and/or mantle flow and 2) Global Navigation Satellite System/Global Position System (GNSS/GPS) geodesy, which I use to measure surface deformation caused by tectonic and magmatic processes. <br> I am also interested in using real-time GNSS/GPS for studying volcanic surface deformation which is an important technic for mitigating volcanic risks and understanding the underlying magma dynamic. <br><br> Contact me at [tahiry.rajaonarison@nmt.edu](mailto:tahiry.rajaonarison.nmt.edu)
