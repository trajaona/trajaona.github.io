# About Me
**I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Earth and Environnemental Sciences at New Mexico Tech.** Using integrated approach of geodynamic modeling and geodetic data and/or seismology, I seek to improve our understanding of the geodynamics of active tectonics. In particular, I am intersted in studying the long-term evolution of geodynamic processes from lithospheric/crustal scales to the mantle, with applications to plate interior and plate boundary deformation, natural hazards, and subsurface energy resource development. My main tools are 3D thermomechanical modeling with the open-source finite-element code Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth’s ConvecTion (ASPECT), which I use to calculate surface deformation and/or mantle flow, and Global Navigation Satellite System/Global Position System (GNSS/GPS) geodesy, which I use to measure surface deformation caused by tectonic and magmatic processes. <br> I am also very interested in using real-time GNSS/GPS for studying volcanic surface deformation which is an important technic for mitigating volcanic risks and understanding the underlying magma dynamic. <br><br> Contact me at [tahiry.rajaonarison@nmt.edu](mailto:tahiry.rajaonarison.nmt.edu)
