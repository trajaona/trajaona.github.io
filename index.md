    excerpt: "**I am a tectonicist and geologist who studies how convergent margin processes build and deform the Earth's lithosphere.** I combine traditional field-based structural geology with geochronology, geochemistry, and numerical modeling to delineate geologic histories and better understand tectonic processes that have operated throughout Earth history. I am also deeply interested in the intersection of geology and the humanities, in particular how we use our understanding of landscapes and deep time to construct our identity as a species. <br><br> I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Davis.<br><br> Contact me at [davasey@ucdavis.edu](mailto:davasey@ucdavis.edu)"
