**I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Earth and Environnemental Sciences at New Mexico Tech.** Using multidisciplinary geophysical approaches, including geodynamic modeling, geodesy, and/or seismology, I seek to improve our understanding of the geodynamics of active tectonics. In particular, I am intersted in studying lithospheric deformation of young continental rifts or rifted margins and its impact on rift basin development, natural hazards, and subsurface energy resource development. My main tools are 3D thermomechanical modeling with the open-source finite-element code Advanced Solver for Problems in Earthâ€™s ConvecTion (ASPECT), which I use to calculate surface deformation and/or mantle flow, and Global Navigation Satellite System/Global Position System (GNSS/GPS) geodesy, which I use to measure surface deformation caused by tectonic and magmatic processes. <br> I am also very interested in using real-time GNSS/GPS for studying volcanic surface deformation which is an important technic for mitigating volcanic risks and understanding the underlying magma dynamic. <br><br> Contact me at [tahiry.rajaonarison@nmt.edu](mailto:tahiry.rajaonarison.nmt.edu)
